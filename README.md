## simple-react-redux
vanilla react redux example

## Motivation
I started to use React one year ago and every time I started a new project I spend hours to create the basics. That's why I created a basic prototype of a react redux project, tested with jest.

## Installation
```
 git clone https://github.com/Selence/simple-react-redux.git
 ```
To build the project run the following:
```
npm run build
```
or
```
npm run watch
```
You can find the whole parsed files in src/client/public

## Tests
```
npm run test
```
The coverage is saved to bin/coverage

## Code
*Root-Path*: src/client<br />
*Components*: /components<br />
*Container*: /container<br />
*Store*: /store<br />
*Actions*: /actions<br />
*Reducers*: /reducers<br />
